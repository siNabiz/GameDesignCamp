One button game designed for University of Waterloo Stratford Campus Christie速 MicroTiles速 Wall

You need to have Unity 5 installed. First build the game for Mac or Windows. The game was made to work the 
2:9 Christie速 MicroTiles速 Wall.

To start the game you need to hold the "space" bar. The game is designed for a two player experience.

Player one uses the left mouse key, and player two the right mouse key.

The two players need to work together to catch as many boxes as possible.
